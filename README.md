This App was created using create-react-app.
The project is  a single-page app about spaceships made by SpaceX.

Used packages : antd design Library, axios, Redux (+thunk), sass.

To run the app on localhost please type : “npm run start”

For the deploy option - GitHub repository is used, 
after each push to master/main branch  - 
the automatic deployment to Netlify is being made right after “tests” are done.
In .github folder - there’s a workflow folder - with yml file,
in which settings for  Github Actions are placed.
After that deployment process starts.
In such way CI/CD is implemented
